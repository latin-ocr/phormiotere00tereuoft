12 INTRODUCTJON.

thus brought into close contact with Greek civilisation at the
very moment when they had leisure to attend to it. There
began at once to arise an ever-increasing demand for a better
education for the Roman youth, and for more varied amuse-
ments for the Roman populace. The satisfaction of these
demands was delayed by the First Punic War, 264-241 B.C.

Livius Andronicus. In 240 B.c. Livius Andronicus, a
Tarentine captive who received his freedom for educating the
sons of Livius Salinator, produced on the Roman stage ¹ a drama
translated from the Greek. He also translated the Odyssey into
Saturnian verse as an educational text-book, which was still in*
use in the boyhood of Horace ². Thus at Rome the beginnings
both of Epic and Dramatic poetry were due not so much to
poetical inspiration as to the needs of the school-room and the
Circus. As might be expected in work thus done to order,
there was little artistic merit. The ¹few fragments which remain
seem crude and barbarous, and we may well believe that the
books were never again opened when the rod of an Orbilius was
no longer dreaded.

Old Athenian Comedy. There could be no doubt as to the
school of Attio Comedy to be chosen for imitation. The Old ι
Comedy of Eupolis, Cratinus or Aristophanes, essentially poli-

satire of public men and public matters, could not have been
reproduced on a Roman stage.

Middle Comedy. Even the poets of the Middle Comedy,
who satirised classes rather than individuals or travestied schools

¹ Serus enim Graecis admovit acumina chartis,
Et post Punica bella quietus quaerere coepit,
Quid Sophocles et Thespis et Aeschylus utile ferrent.
Hor. Ep. 2. 1. 161-163.

² Non equidem insector delendave carmina Livi
Esse reor, memini quae plagosum mila· parvo
Orbilium dictare. ’
Hor. Ep. 1. 2. 1. 69—71.
