394—5. esses proferens =pr0serres. This is an early instance of the
tendency of Latin, as of other languages, to become ‘ analytic; ' i. e. to
express changes of case, tense, mood, voice, or person by the addition of
separate words, e. g. prepositions‚ auxiliary νεὼς, pronouns, etc„ in-
stead of by case-endings or verbal inflexions. The latter method is
called ‘synthetic.’ Greek is a good example of a ‘synthetic,' English
of an ‘ analytic ’ language. Analytic varieties are, however,rmore frequent
in Greek than Latin. Cf. And. 508, 775 ut sz's sciens=ut scias, Cic.
