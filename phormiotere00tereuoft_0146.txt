ab sua palaestra, ‘ from his own special school;’ the term
palaestra, ‘wrestling school ’ or ⁶ gymnasium ’ is here comically applied

to the 1house where Pamphila lives, because Phaedria goes there so
regular y.

ACT ΙΙ. SCENE 5. [ΙΙΙ. 2.] ,

Phaedria begs Dorio, the owner of Pamphila, to give him three days’
grace. Dorio is obdurate: he has an offer for the girl, and will not

throw away ready money for tears and promises. ‘First pay, first
serve ’ is his mott0. ’

486. non audio. Note the Present; ef. 447 note.
quin. Cf. 209 note.
omitte me, ‘let go of me?

490. mirabar si . . . novi, ⁶ I thought it would be a miracle if you
had anything new to say to me 3’ cf. And. 175 mirabar hoc si sic abiret.
The use of quicquam for quid implies Dorio's conviction that there was
nothing new.

491. Translate, ‘ AN. I fear this fellow, lest he should— GE. devise
some mischief for himself? That is just what I am afraid of.’ Antipho
was going to say, ‘lest he should do some harm to Phaedria.‘ Geta,
interrupting‚ substitutes significantly ‘ some mischief for himself, do you
mean?' meaning to convey a strong hint to Dorio that he might drive
the young men to take violent measures, as Aeschinus did with Sannio
in the Adelphi. The words idem egv vereor are of course spoken at
Dorio.

suat, lit. ‘ patch ’ or ‘ seW,’ whence sutor ‘ a tailor; ’ only here in
metaphorical sense.

492. har-inlate, ‘you are talking nonsense.’ The significant change
in the meaning of this word, as also of vaticinari, shows into what dis-
repute soothsaying must have fallen before this date. Cf. μαίνομαι and
μαντική, Plato Phaedr. 245 B. c., Ad. 202.

493. faeneratum . . . dices, ‘you will say that this kindness was
richly repaid with interest.' Cf. Ad. 219 metuisti . . . ne non‘tibi istuc

faeneraret? Both faeneror and faenero are found3 Augustan writers
prefer faeneror.
