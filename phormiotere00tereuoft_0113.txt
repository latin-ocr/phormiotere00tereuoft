NOTES. LJNES 1-18. ’ 109

5. Translate, ‘ that the plays . . . are poor in execution and common-
place in style.’ oratio is the manner in which the plot (argumentum)
is worked out. scriptura is either (a) ‘ the style of the composition ' =
stilus, here and Andr. 12 3 or (β) ‘the work composed ; ’ cf. Hec. Prol.
2. 13 ne cum poeta scriptura evanesceret ,· ib. 245 Ad. 1.

levi, opposed to gravi, ‘ stately.'

6. adulescentulum, more correct than adolescentulum.

7. cervam fugere etc. depend on adulescentulum videre. In Terence
video is often followed by an Ins. with Ace. expressed or underst00d;
sometimes by a Participle‚ as is the rule with Augustan writers. Cf.
177, 621. We know nothing of the passage here alluded to, but we
gather that the style of Lanuvinus was somewhat sensational and melo-
dramatic. Insane delusions have often been represented on the stage,
notably in the Ajax of Sophocles.

9. intellegeret, more correct than intelligeret.

quom, always so spelt in Plautus and Terence. Latin writers till
the end of the republican period avoided u after u or v. The correct
form in Cicero is cum.

stetit, ‘succeeded3’ stare was technically used of a play in this
sense. This is one of the very few instances in which Terence retains
’ the archaic long quantity of a final syllable. Cf. Ad. 25 augea-t
industriam. Cf. p. 30.

10. Actoris, possibly Ambivius Turpio. Lanuvinus might have
retorted that this was true of the Hecyra.

13. lacessisset:laces-sivisset. Syncopation is more common in
Terence than in Augustan Latin. Cf. 198 note.

14. prologum, in spite of πρόλογος; είρἰΐέα and πλατεῖα, ενῷἴιίαηι
and κρηπῖδα, pr5pinare and προπίνειν.

16. in medio etc„ ‘is for open competition among all.’ Cf. ἐν μέσῳ
κεῖται. For the opposite e medio see 967, 1019.

17. artem musicam=Gr. μουσικήν, which includes all literary,
scientific‚ and artistic pursuits, opposed to γυμναστική. Translate,
‘ who cultivate dramatic art.'

18. ab studio studuit. The juxtaposition of two words of the same
root is common in Terence. This is merely a special form of Assonance,
and is to be distinguished from Agnominatio or Paronomasia, which,
strictly speaking, is a play upon words of similar sound but different
sense, something akin to a pun, e. g. Andr. 218 inceptio est amentium
haud amantium. Paronomasia is fairly common in Plautus, but rare
in Terence. The term is sometimes extended to a play upon different
meanings of the same word, such as is not uncommon in Cicero, e. gx.
ius Verrinam.
