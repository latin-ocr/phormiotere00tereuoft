Jupiter so preserve me according as . . . .’ Cf. Roby 715 f.

questions about it ? '

by thirty minae, and his own wmtchedness, from which there seems no
escape.

820. ut is usually said to be here equivalent to ut ut, ‘ however,’ as
4683 but it makes good sense =‘considering that? Antipho is glad
that his cousin's anxiety is relieved since his own is so pressing.

fratri = patrueli, a cousin on his father's side.

821. scitum, ‘ sensible.’ Cf. 110 note.

822. sient, Subjunctive, because the statement is general and in-
definite.
