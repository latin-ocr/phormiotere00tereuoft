NOTES. LJNES 117—141. , ’119

her next of kin (ἄγχιστεῢς) was bound -to marry her, or to provide an
additional dowry. Cf. Diod. Sic. 12. 18. 2, 3. Such a girl was called
ἐπίκληρος, and the person making application' for her hand was said
ἐπιδικάζεσθαι. Cf. note on Didascalia ; Numbers xxxvi. 8. Demos-
thenes in Mac. 1067 ad fin. tells us that there was a fine of 500 drachmae
for a πεντακοσιομέδιμνος, 300 for a ἴππείις, and 150 for a ζευγίτης.

127. scribam dicam = γράψομαι δικὴν. Cf. 329, 439, 668. Here
there is a play upon dicam and dicam.

128. paternum amicum =· patris amicum ; cf. 39 note.

me, sub. esse.

130. qm', ‘ how3' cf. 123 note.

131. quod . . . commodum, ‘ as shall be good and expedient for my
case.' Most editors connect this clause with what follows, but it seems
more natural to take it with confingam, quod being an Acc. of respect.

132. quom . . . refelles. The case was to be undefended.

133. mihi paratae lites, ‘ I am in for a row3' a colloquial usage,
cf. 219, Ad. 792.

quid mea, sc. refert? ‘ What care I ?’

134. iocularem audaciam! Ace. of exclamation. ‘ What amusing
impudence Ξ ’

135. ventum est. Cf. 129.

vincimur, plural because Geta identifies himself with Antipho.

137. quid te futurum est ἱ) ‘ What will become of you? ’ Cf. 811.
Facere, fieri, esse, in the sense of ‘ to do anything with a person,' ‘ any-
thing to be done with, or happen to a person,' are constructed with the
Dative or Ablative without a preposition, rarely with de and the Abla-
tive. Cf. Andr. 116 quid jacias illi ἓ ib. 614 quid me faciam ,⁶⁹ infra.
426, Pl. Trin. 405 quidfactum est eo ἕ Ad. 996 sed cle fratre quid fiet ?
Cic. Fam. 14. 4. 3 quid Tulliola mea fiet .?

138. Pyrrhus in Ennius An. 204 is made to say . . . quidve ferat fors

virtute experiamur. This makes the sentiment in Geta’s mouth yet
more absurd.

placet, ‘ well said,’ ‘ hear, hear.’
139. hem! Cf. 52 note.
140. laudo, ‘ bravo 1’ ⁸
ad. precatorem adeam, credo, ‘ I am to betake myself to an in-
tercessor, I suppose.' From allusions in the comediam, e. g. Heaut.
976, 1002, we gather that it was customaxy for a slave when in trouble
to enlist the services of a precator. For credo parenthetical cf. 40.
141. amitte hunc, ‘let him off ; ’ often in this sense in Plautus and

Terence. Donatus says, quod nos dicimus dimittere, antiqui etiam dice-
bant amittere. Cf. 175, 176, 414, 918.
