METRES AND PROSODY. 25

among the comedies of Terence. In it we find nothing so
farcical as the ‘ baby-scene’ in the Andria, nor has it the
exquisite polish and pervading moral purpose of the Adelphi.
But the dialogue is more pointed and the interest better sustained
than in the earlier play, while what is lost in finish is gained in
vigour when compared with the later. Moliere has made the
Phormio the basis of a farce, Les Fourberz‘es de Scapin, but no
impartial critic would prefer the copy to the original.

METRES AND PROSODY.

The object of this Introduction is to explain briefly the metres
employed by Terence in the Phormio, and to clear up such
apparent difficulties of Prosody as may remain after.the general
scheme of the metres is understood.

These metres are Iambic and Trochaic, which receive their
names from being composed of iambi or trochees‚ as the case
may be, or of some other feet, considered to be equivalent: and
the lines are further subdivided according to the number of
metres which they contain, and according to their complete or
incomplete form. In iambic and trochaic lines a series of two
feet is called a melre (or dipodz'a)‚ and the name of the line
corresponds to the number of these metres; thus an iambic
trimeter is an iambic line containing three metres or six feet3
atrochaic tetrameter is a trochaic line containing four metres
or eight feet. Again, some lines have a number of complete
feet; these are called acatalectic3 while others are called cata-
lectic, because the last foot is incomplete. Thus a trochaic
tetrameter catalectic is a trochaic line of four metres or eight

feet, wanting the last syllable, and really containing only seven
feet and a half.
