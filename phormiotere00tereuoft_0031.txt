PROSOD Y. 27

PROSODY.

v The rules of prosody‚ as commonly taught, must be con-
siderably modified, if we are to understand the scansion of
Plautus and Terence. It must always be remembered that
the poets of the late days of the Republic and their successors
were writing in a literary dialect, notin the language of every-
dayfife. The quantity of any syllable was regarded as rigidly
fixed, just as we might find it marked in a dictionary. But in
reading the comic poets we find that acc-ent must be considered
as well as quantity. Scansion was determined by the ear, not
by any hard and fast rules. Just as in Shakesperian verse
loved may be scanned as of one syllable or of two, and the same
word may be pronounced as long or short according to its
position, so in Terence eim, huius, quoz'ch, etc.‚ may be mono-
syllabic or dissyllabic, and the same syllable may be used with
a different quantity according to the requirements of the metre.
This latter variation of quantity is however not arbitrary, but
conforms to a general law, which may be thus stated.

⁷ When the metrical aoeent 1 falls on the first: syllable
of an Iambus, or on the syllable before , or aster an
Iambus, the second syllable of the Iambus may be
shortened. ’

Accordingly in Iambic metre,

(a)—x.'3—=—c'20, (ὖ)υ--’Ξυυ-’-ἰ
in Trochaic metre,

(C) -ὐ- Ξ-ίυυ,

(θ’)ύ--τ-...ύυ-, (θ’)ύ-υεύυυ.

It will be noted that in the following examples some of the
shortened syllables would by the ordinary rules be long by
nature, others long by position.

¹ In Iambic-metre the accent falls on the second syllable of all feet
except anapaests and proceleusmatics‚ which are accented on the third : in
Trochaic metre the aecent is always on the first syllable.
