905. ut mi esset fides, ‘ to preserve my honour?
906. idque adeo. Cf. 389.

908. ita. uti par fuit,‘ as was fitting.5

912. potuit, sc. dari

913. eam nune extrudi, so A, four later MSS. reading nunc viduam
extrudi.

915. inluditis me. Terence¹ constructs inludere thrice with the
direct Ace„ once with in and Acc., Eun. 942, once with in and Abl.‚
And. 758. Cicero uses both the direct Ace.‚ in with Ace.. and also the
Dat„ which last construction is found also in Vergil and Tacitus. Its
usual meaning is ‘to make game of ; ' very rare1y ‘to sport with,' as
Hor. Sat. 1. 4. 139.

qui. Cf. 123 note.
917. redibo . . . contempserim. We should have expected redeam
. . contempserim or redibo . . . contempsi .· but we have seen (447 note)
how the Pres. Indic. may be colloquially used for a Pres. Subj., so that
the use of a Fut. Simple fora Pres. Subj. need not surprise us. The
Homeric student will remember how these tenses are often inter-
changeable in early Greek.

918. amittere. Cf. 141 note.

921. sodes. Gf. 103 note.

922. rescribi, ‘ to be re-transferred.’ Both at Athens and Rome the

place by men called in Greek τραπεζῖται, in Latin argentarii.

923. quodne ego discripsi porro. ‘what? the money which 1

ι immediately paid away! Note that the question is asked by ne, not by

quod, which 1s not here interrogative.
porro. Cf. 746 note.

92 5. sin es't ut velis, periphrastic for sin velis ,⁴ compare the use of
fore ut.

926. hie, δεικτικῶς, pointing to himself.

928. alterae, archaic for alteri. Pronouns forming the Gen. and Dat.
in —ius and -i are occasionally declined by Terence like a regular adjec-
tive in -us -a -um, e. g. And. 608 nulli :nullius, Eun. 1004 milzz'
solae. Nulli consili is also read Cic. Rosc. 16, ᾗ 48.
