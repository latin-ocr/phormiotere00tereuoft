144 PHORMIO.

quotes the Greek proverb, τῶν ὤτων ἔχω τὸν λύκον· οὔτ’ ἔχειν οὔτ’
ἀφεῖναι δύναμαι. Cf. ‘ I've caught a Tartar?
508. ipsum . . . est, ‘that is exactly my case with him.'
ne . . . sies, ‘you are afraid of being a scoundrel by halves.' In

{ise parallel passage Pl. Pers. 4. 6. 4 the verb of fearing is expressed.
. 313 note.

509. confecit, ‘ has he settled?’

511. ancillam, sc. vendere.

512. ut me maneat, ‘ to give me time.’

cum illo . . . fidem, ‘ to break saith with his customer.’

515. emundes, sc. aures, ‘will you keep dinning this into me Τ
obtundere aures, ‘to beat at the ears,' comes to mean ‘ to importune,’ or
‘ to annoy by constant repetition,' like the Hellenistic use of ὑπωπιάζειν,
St. Luke 18. 5 (B. and W.). Cf. And. 348.

exoret sine: sino may be followed by a Subj, with or without ut,
or by an Infin.; cf. 517.
516. ‘ He too will surely repay you twofold for any service you may
have rendered.’
conduplicaverit. A* Fut. Perf. is often used by Plautus and
Terence to express a future action to be quickly and certainly performed,
where in English we should employ a Fut. Simple. Cf. 681‚'882, etc.
idem, used, as so often, as a particle of transition.

518. horune=h0rum-ce, cf. 290.

519. neque ego neque tu, ‘it won’t be my doing nor yours either ;’
i.e. it is Phaedria’s fault for not paying over the money.

quod es dignus, sc. acczPere, or quod may be Acc. after the verbal
idea contained in dignus es= mereris.
duint. Cf. 123 note. .

521. contra. omnia haec. Some editors, believing that contra is not
used as a preposition as early as Terence, put a stop after haec, under-
standing sunt. But though the adverbial use is much more common,
contra is found as an undoubted preposition Pl. Ps. 155 adsistite omnes
contra me, ib. Pers. 1. 1. 13; and it is far more natural to take it as
such here and in the parallel passage Ad. 44 ille contra haec omnia
Ruri agere vitam.

522. da locum melioribus, said to have been a formula used by a
Consul's lictors in clearing the way.

524· quam ad, so all MSS. If the reading be correct, this is the
sole instance of ad standing after its case. Bentley conjectures quoad.
Tr. ‘unless my memory deceives me, there was assuredly a date once
fixed for you to pay him.‘ Usually dies, ‘ a day,’ is masculine, dies,
‘ time,’ feminine.
