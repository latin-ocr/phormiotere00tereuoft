NOTES. LINES 180-198. 125

from the military phrase vasa colligere, ‘ to pack up.’ The few things
would be of course his master’s property.

The text gives the reading of all MSS„ and must be scanned as
an Iambic octonarius. To do so seems so unlikelyin this place that
most editors prefer the violent expedient of reading protinam, an archaic
form of protinus found in Plautus and mentioned here by Donatus, and
scanning it as prb'ti'nam‚ for which there seems no justification.

192. qua. quaerere insistam via Ρ ‘where (lit. by what road) shall
Ι begin to look for him ἲ ’ insistere, ‘ to stand ⁹ or ‘ press upon ’ may
be construeted with a Dat. or in with Abl. or a simple Ace. ; while in
the sense off to set about,’ ‘to begin,’ it is followed by an Inf. as here.
A confusion of these usages probably accounts for the reading viam in

193. neseio quod magnum . . . malum, ‘ some great calamity or
other.’ If nescio quod had meant ‘ I do not know what‚’ the following
verb would have been in the Subj. Nescio quid, ‘somewhat‚' is often
used to qualify a verb or adjective. lVescz'o may be scanned as a dactyl
or as a spondee by Synizesis. Cf. p. 31.

194. sanun=sanusne.

ibi plurimum est, ‘ he is mostly there.'

195. ilico may here be of place, ‘where you are,'‘ or of time, ‘at

onoe.’ Cf. 88 note.
eatis pro inperio, sub. loqueris, ⁶ you give your orders peremp-
torily enough?

196. The grammatical order is Ipse est obviam, quem volui, ‘ here is
the very man I want.' Cf. Andr. 532 eccum ipfflm obviam.

197. cedo, ‘tell me.' This archaic imperative (‘ tell me ' or ‘give
me ’) is used by Cicero. The plural cette is only found in old Latin.
Cf. 321, 329, 398, 550, 642, 692, etc.

verbo expedi, ‘ explain it in a word.’
198. meumne = meumne patrem vz‘dz'stz‘? a striking ellipse.
intellexti. A similar syncopation (z's‘ being omitted) of verbs
whose Pers. Ind. ends in -sz‘‚ -xz'‚ is used by Latin poets:
(1) in the second pers. sing. Perf. Ind. (often), e. g. dixti (often),
e. g. 537, and second pers. plur. (rarely)·
(2) in - Pers. Infin. Cf. Andr. 561 produxe, Heaut. 32 decesse,
ib. 1001 iusse.
(3) in all persons sing. and first pers. plur. of Pluperf. Subj.; but
none of this set occur in Terence.

The syncopation of -avistz', -avz‘ssem, -ovisti, -0vz‘ssem‚ etc„ into -astz'‚

·assem‚ -ostz', -ossem‚ etc„ is too common to require detailed notice.
Hem! This is an exclamation of surprise at Antipho's consterna-
