ι 38 PHORMIO.

eu, Gr. εὖ, so euge, Gr. εὖγε. Tr. ‘well done our side.'

400. si fuerat. The Pluperf. Indic. after si is rare.

401. filium narras mihi Ρ ‘ What! talk to me of my son ‘e’ '
Terence sometimes uses narrare: ⁵ to speak about‚’ ‘ to mention.'

402. poto-t, impersonal, ef. 303. ”

403. magistratus adi, ‘ make an application before the magistrate&
so followed by ut and Subj. because equivalent to a verb of asking.

405. solus regnas, Cf. Ad. 175 regnumne, Aeschine, tu hic
possides? Pl. Trin. 695 quid? te dictatorem censes fore ? This can
hardly be considered as a distinctively Roman allusion, since a ‘ tyrant '
at Athens was almost as great a bug-bear as a ⁴ king ’ at Rome. Phormio
would of course lay special emphasis on alterum, eadem, bis, as well as
on solus regyzas and soli.

To have a case heard twice was illegal at Athens, cf. Dem. Lept.
p. 502 ; but at Rome there-might be a ‘ restitutio in integrum‚' cf. 451.

409. ut . . . si instead of the usual quasi, because ut naturally follows.
itidem.

410. dotis dare etc. The logical order would be, abduc hanc,
minas quinque accipe, id dotis quod lex iubet dare. The omission of
the subject of dare makes the statement more general, as we should say
in English, ‘ the dowry which the law orders one to give ; ’ dari would
have been more usual, dare being probably more colloquial. Demipho's
excitement quite accounts for the irregular order of the clauses.

abdue. Cf. 309 note.
minas. The Attic mina= 100 drachmae=fi4 rs. 3d.

411. homo. Cf. lzoch 123.

413. tandem. Cf. 231 note.

414. amittere=dimittere. Cf. 141 note.

415. ut ne. Cf. 168 note. f

418. at nos unde, sc'. proxumi sumus ? ‘ but where does she get us
from Ῥ ’

419. ‘actum,’ aiunt, ‘ne agas,’ ‘the proverb says, “don’t kill a
dead dog.'' ' The Latin proverb is from the law-courts, ‘ don't bring on a*
case already decided,' cf. Ad. 232.

420. ineptis. Terence only uses the verb here and Ad. 934.

sine modo, ‘ do you just let me alone : ' modo emphasises the
Imperative. Cf. 496. r

426. tu te idem melius feceris, ‘it would be better to do that
to yourself,’ i. e. to leave the house yourself. It is best to consider
te as‘ Abl. aster feceris, cf. 137 note, and idem as neuter, though idem
might be taken as emphasising tu without material alteration of the
sense.
