PROSODY. 29

¹2yllable3 and in *support of their theory they cite the quantities
of mdle, qudsi, citb‘ as contrasted with certe, etsi, rara, etc.
-Others consider that the metrical accent is alone sufficient to
account for all shortened syllables. The true explanation will
probably be found in a combination of both theories‚ i. e. that a
natural tendency of colloquial pronunciation to shorten the long
syllable of an iambus was extended by the incidence of the

metrical accent. At any rate the law seems clearly established, ’

though its origin may be doubtful.

Ample evidence exists to prove that final consonants were often
>tightly pronounced. The disappearance of d from the end of
the archaic ablative singular, of m from the first person singular
of the present indic. active and other tenses, the alternative
form for the third person plural of the perf. indic. active (dedere
for dederunt) may be cited as instances. But in the case of final
m and s we have special and explicit testimony. Quintilian 9.
4. 40 tells us that ‘m parum expm‘mitur‚’ Priscian 1. 38 ‘ m
obscurum in extremitate dictionum sonat,·’ and accordingly we
find final m regularly elided before a vowel or h even in Augus-
tan verse, while in the comic writers it can be disregarded or
not at will, e. g. enimvero, quidem and the like are exceedingly
common.

As regards s, Cicero Or. 161 writes, quod iam subrusticum
vastetur, olim autem politius, eorum verborum, quorum eaedem
erant postremae duae litterae quae sunt in ‘ optumus,’ pos-
tremam litteram detrahebant, nisi vocalis insequebatur. Ita
non erat ea ostiensia in versibus quam nunc fugiunt poetae novi.
Ita enim loquebamur ‘ qui est omnibu’ princeps,’ non ‘omnibus
princeps‚’ et ‘vita illa dignu’ locoque‚' non ‘dignus' Lucre-
tius, and of course theolder poets Ennius and Lucilius, fre-
quently drop the final s after u, especially in the dat. and abl.
plural in —bus. Terence often avails himself 'of this licence,
e. g. 943 sepultu‘s sum at the end of a senarius.

Similarly opus est, factus est, etc., may always be scanned
opu’st, factu’st when convenient, e. g. 715, 833, etc. So also
umatus es may metrically be amatu's. It was doubtless too in
