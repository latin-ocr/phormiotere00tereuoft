708. gallina cecinit, ‘ a hen crowed‚' sc. like a cock. This was an
omen, according to Donatus, that the wife would survive the husband.
708-9. hariolus, haruspex, synonymous terms for a soothsayer who
interpreted omens from the entrails of victims (Sans. hira = entrails).
The art soon fell into disrepute among the educated classes, cf. 492 note.
Note that the whole system of omens at Rome had a practical bearing.
The signs warned men to do or not to do some act, and so the auspices
were taken or soothsayers consulted before any undertaking of import-
anee in public or private lise. Cf. Hor. Od. 3. 27. 1-7-

aliquid is only found as a correction in E, Eugraphius reading
quid. Otherwise the MSS. read autem, which is in itself awkward and
leaves negoti without a construction. Many editors place a colon after
vetuit and assume the loss of two half-verses between inczjere and quae.
But of this there is no trace in the MSS. or the Scholiasts, and it seems
the least of the difficulties to read aliquid.
711. me vide, ‘ look to me‚’ ‘ trust to me! Cf. And. 350, Pl. Trin.

ACT III. SCENE 5. [IV. 5.]

The old gentlemen re-appear with the money for Phormio. Chremes
is manifestly apprehensive of some trickery, but Demipho is confident
that no one will get the better of him. Chremes is also anxious that
Nausistrata should be sent to break the news to Phanium, and his
brother somewhat impatiently assents.

713. ne quid verborum duit, ‘that he practise no trickery on us ; '
verba dare = ‘to cheat,’ cf. altercari, ‘to quarrel.’ Such phrases are
very significant of Roman mannerS.
