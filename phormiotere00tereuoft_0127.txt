NOTES. LJNES 159-179· 123

msive pronouns‚ rarely to personal pronouns 3 while -teis found with
cases of tu only. Cf. 280, 467, 766, 914.

x 173. videre. Plautus and Terence usually prefer the form in -re of
second pers. sing. pass. to that in -rz‘s except for metrical reasons.
Cicero and Vergil follow the same custom except in the Pres. Ind. On
the other hand Livy and Tacitus seldom use the form in -νε,

174. de integro, ‘free1y.‘ The phrase Andr. 26=‘aneW.’ In both
cases the derivative meaning (in privative and stem οξ tango) is easily
traced. ·

etiam (Gr. ἔτι), ‘even yet‚’ as often.

175. retinere, amare, amittere. So all MSS. Most editors, seeing
the altematives neque mittendi nec retinendi in 176, get rid of amare ;
e. g. retinere amorem an mittere (Dz.‚ Fleck.‚ etc.): retinere eam anne
amittere (B. and W. following Dz. first ed.). Bentley reads retinere
amare an mittere. To add amare to retinere is no doubt more lover-
like than logical, but that seems hardly sufficient reason for altering
Antipho's words, which all MSS. give without variation.

For amittere cf. 141 note.

176. ut neque mihi sit amittendi. So A. with Donatus and
Servius. This reading involves the scansion mihi, which is uncommon
in Terence. B C D EG P with A„ insert eius after sit. If this
reading be accepted it is an instance of the gerund used in a purely
substantival sense, with a genitive after it, ‘ of the dismissal of her;’ cf.
Heaut. 29 novarum qui spectandi faciunt copiam, Hec. 372 eius (sc.
uxoreis) videndi cupidus recta consequor. This construction, which also
occurs in Plautus, Lucretius, Cicero, and Suetonius, is instructive· as
showing how entirely the gerund was once a verbal noun. One MS.
F gives mi ius sit.

177. videon . . . advenire Ρ ‘Do Ι see Geta come running hither?’

178. ipsus, archaic for ipse, common in Terence.

ei, interjection‚ often written hei.

ACT Ι. SCENE 4.

Geta appears in great perturbation‚ having heard of the sudden arrival
of Demipho. Phaedria and the slave try to screw Antipho's courage to
the sticking-point, but in vain. When the old man is seen approaching

ffiipho hurriedly decamps, leaving his brother to bear the brunt of his
er s anger.

ἈΔ-(11759. nunus ee, ‘you are done for‚' a colloquial phrase. Cf. 942,
. 99.
