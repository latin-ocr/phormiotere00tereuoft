791. ‘ Yes, two talents, and that when prices were much lower.’

792. quid haec videntur? seilicet. This question and answer are
obscure. The meaning may be, (1) ‘ What do you think of this? ' ‘ Of
course you are right:' or (2) ‘ What! do you think so?’ (referring to
Demipho's hui! of admiration). ‘Of course I d0.' Hence Colman's
translation, ‘Whatt are you surprised ? ’ ‘ Prodigiously. ' In any case
Demipho's scilicet is not likely to be either ironical or absent, as
supposed by some, since he is very anxious to pay Nausistrata every
attention.

natum, the reading of A, is more characteristic of Nausistrata
than natam.

793. parce sodes, ‘please spare yourself? Cf. 103 note.

794. cum issa, sc. conloqui. Demipho expected a scene.

795. abs te. Cf. 732 note.

Ac'r IV. SCENE 3. [V.‘3.]

As Demipho and Nausistrata approach the house, Chremes comes
out in great excitement frogn an interview with his daughter. He wants
of course to stop any further proceedings with reference to Phanium,
but finding Nausistrata with Demipho he cannot explain matters,
Demipho gets impatient and Nausistrata suspicious at his inexplicable
conduct and manifest agitation, and only with great difficulty does
Chremes get his wife safely back into her own house, so that he can
impart to his brother the news which he has been bursting to tell.
