stranger, agrees to provide the money from his wife's income.
All this has been overheard by Antipho in the background.
He is nearly beside himself with anger at what he supposes to
be Geta’s treachery, and grief at the prospect of being com-

the house to communicate his great piece of news. As soon
as they have disappeared Antipho enters, quickly followed by

Phormio, in high spirits at having secured the money sor ·

Phaedria who has lost no time in having his Pamphila formally
