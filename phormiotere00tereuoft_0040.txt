36 JNTROD UCTJON. γ {-

The Bembine is by far the most important, not merely on
account of its antiquity, but because it alone 'has escaped the
recension of Calliopius in the seventh century. Codex A was
in bad condition, as its owner Cardinal Bembo testified, before
the end of the fifteenth century. Andria 1—786 is now entirely
wanting, and of Adelphi 914—997 only a few letters are legible.

It bears a note written by Politian (1493 A.D.) to the effect ,
that he never-saw so old a Codex. The hands of two correctors
can be discerned ε one of ancient date, which only appears twice -3
in the Andria, and never in the Phormio or Adelphi ; the other 1, 4
about the fifteenth century, which changed and added cha· ὴ
racters in a ‘downright shameless fashion.’ But, where not ἶ
thus tampered with, Codex A possesses an authority sufficient >
to outweigh all the other MSS. taken together, though the
scribe was not a very careful one, and not unfrequently made „
palpable mistakes in copying. The later MSS. were so much
altered by the Calliopian recension that their independent J
authority is not very great. In all MSS., even in A, the spelling
has been much modernised.

The evidence of the MSS. is to some small extent supple· 'f
mented by quotations of ancient writers, and the commentaries j
of grammarians. Ἴ,-

Of these latter, the most important is Aelius Donatus, tutor of
St. Jerome, about 350 A.D., and the author of a celebrated gram- Β
matical treatise which became the common text-book of me-
diaeval schools. Priscian (480? A.D.), Servius (about 420 A. D.)
in his notes on Vergil, and other more obscure scholiasts are of
occasional service.

no es y 2.
