NOTES. LJNES 592-618. 149

610. volup est, ‘ 1 arn delighted: ’ volup, or volupe as it appears in
many MSS.‚ is from the obsolete volchz‘s, whence Volupz'a, the goddess
of pleasure, voluptas, etc.: in Terence only here and Hec. 857, fairly
common in Plautus, never in Augustan writers. Cf. Gr. ἐλπίς.

eredo. Cf. 255.
quid agitur? ‘how goes it?’ a common form of salutation, like
qued fit 9

611. ‘There are many changes here, as is usual when one first comes

home—very many?

compluria, the older form of complura, which accounts sor the Gen.
complurium. Neither Plautus nor Terence use pluria, though Gellius
mentions it as the original form.

614. circumiri, ‘ to be circumvented: ' so also circumvenire ; in
English ‘ to get round a man.'

id . . . commodum, ‘ I was talking with him about that just now.'

commodum, used in the comic writers as a temporal adverb, either
:opportune,‘ in the nick of time,' e. g. Pl. Trin. 400, or= modo, ‘just
now‚' as here3 only ante· and post· —classicaL Gr. ἀρτίως.

615. nam hercle. Nam is thus joined to words of asseveration, not
giving any logical confirmation of the preceding statement, but as a
connective particle with what follows In English ‘and indeed.' Cf.
Ad. 190.

agitans, ‘ turning the matter over.'

617. abs te. Cf. 188 note.

618. qui Phormio f> ‘what Phormio?' Donaldson‚ Varr. p. 381,
following Kritz, and apparently Madvig, ξ 88, obs. 1, maintain that quis
and quid merely ask for the name, but qui and quod (interrogative)
inquire respecting the kind, condition, or quality of the person or thing.
The truth seems to be that in many cases the substantival use of quis
and the adjectival use of qui are attended with this distinction of mean-
ing, which naturally arises from the form of the sentence, e. g. Eun. 823-4
T H. Quis suit zgitur? ΡΥ. Iste Chaerea. T H. Qui Chaerea ? But
that this distinction is not inherent in the actual words quis and qui is
clear from the fact that quis est Phormio? quid est remedium ? would
require the same answer as qui Phormio? quod remedium ? and that
Cicero uses qui before a consonant, quis before a vowel. In many cases
where quis seems to be used adjectivally the irregularity is only apparent,
e. g. And. 965 quis homo est? ‘who is there ?' is literally ‘ who is the
man?' Verg. G. 2. 178 quis color, ⁶ what is its distinguishing colourl '
Cf. 990-1.
