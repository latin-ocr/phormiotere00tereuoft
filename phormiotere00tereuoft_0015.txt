ROMAN COMEDY AND TERENCE. 11

an after-picce, like the Satyric drama among the Greeks, and
was regularly performed by professional actors. The name
Atellanae, from Atella, an Oscan town near Capua, gave rise to
the erroneous supposition that these farces were performed at
Rome in the Oscan dialect ; whereas it was only in accordance
with Roman custom to give to dramatic performances a local

Fescennia or Oscan Atella.

Contact with Greek oivffisation. Moreover, in addition

centuries the Romans had been engaged in a varying, yet almost
ceaseless struggle for supremaey, or even for existence. The
defeat of Pyrrhus, 274 B.C., and the final conquest of Tarentum
and the other ‘cities of Magna Graecia a few years later, left
