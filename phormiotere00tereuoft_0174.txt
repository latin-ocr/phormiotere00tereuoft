Cantor. Between two or more of the Acts of a Roman Comedy
it was the custom to introduce a lyrical monologue (canticum) with a
flute accompaniment. Cf. Pl. Ps. 1. 5. 158-160.
Concedere aliquantisper lzinc mthz' intro lubet,
Dum concenturio in corde sycophantias,
Tibicen vos interea hic delectabant.
Sometimes these Cantica were an integral part of the Play, and we
leam from Livy 7. 2 that, iu order to save his voice, Livius Andronicus
placed a boy on the stage to sing the words, while he himself acted the
part in dumb show. This boy was probably the Cantor, who came
forward at the end of the last Act and said to the audience ‘ plaudite.’

Cf. Hor. A. P. 155 donec Cantor ‘ vos plaudite ’ dicat. In all
Terence's plays the MSS. mark the Cantor by Ω. The actors are often
indicated by letters of the Greek alphabet in the order of their appear-
ance on the stage, and Ω was naturally appropriated to the Cantor
because he always came on last. In this play the Cantor is Flaccus,
slave of Claudius. Cf. Didascalia.

Just as in Greek drama the lyrical element became less and less
prominent in proportion as the dialogue (diverbia) was elabomted, so
we find that in Terence the Cantica are few and unimportant as compared
with those of Plautus: e. g. in the Trinummus there are three Cantica
