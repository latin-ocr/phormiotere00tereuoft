1 10 ΡΗ ORMIO.

rEi'eere, contracted form of rejicere ; cf. 717, Verg. E. 3. 96 reice
capellas. Translate, ‘to reduce 'to beggary.'

19. hie. Cf. 1 note.

20. audisset bene, ‘he would have been well spoken of ;’ audire
bene or male is often used thus, e. g. 359. Cf. καλῶς ‘or κακῶς ἀκούειν.

21. rellatum=red-latu7n by assimilation. Lucretius uses both rel-
latus and re‘latus ,· cf. 86 redducere, 646. Translate, ‘ Let him consider
that he has been paid back in his own coin.’

22. dicundi. This was the archaic spelling of the Gerund and
Gerundive. At the period of Terence the forms in ·undus and -endus
were used side by side for verbs of the third or fourth conjugation,
except that -undus is never admitted where the verb-stem ends in u or v.
The older form was much affected by Sallust, and is frequently used by
Augustan writers, especially in legal or political phrases, e.g. iure
dicundo, res repetundae, being most ‘common in verbs of the fourth
conjugation‚ ire and its compounds always retaining the form in -undus,
while gerundus and ferandus are usually found in Cicero, Caesar, and
Livy. The archaic form is, however, seldom used, as here (and 50),
for the Gerund.

23. quom, ‘ although! In Plautus often, in Terence occasionally,
quom causal or concessive is followed by the Indicative. Cicero regu·
larly uses this construction after such verbs as laudo, gaudeo, doleo,
gratulor, and, if the reading be correct, in Off. 1. 44. 157 atque ut apum
examina non fingendorum favorum causa congregantur, sed, cum con-
gregabilia natura sunt, fingunt favos ,· sic homines . . . Cf. 208, 967.

Some editors place a note of interrogation after facit, but there is
a good sense without a question. ‘ I will now say no more about him,
though he on his side does yet more offend.‘

de se is inserted to answer to de illo, emphasising the unprovoked
character of the attack. The sense which is here given to de is
unusual.

24. novam, sc. new to the Roman stage.

2 5. Epidicazomenon. Cf. note on Didascalia.

26. Latini etc„ ‘its Latin title is Phormio.' Bentley’s emendation
was Graece, Latine.

27. primas partis qui aget, ‘the leading character,’ Gr. πρωτα-
γωνιστής.

Phormio, from φορμός, a mat, indicating the grovelling character
of a parasite.

partis. The Ace. plural of such nouus of the third declension as
form the Gen. plural in —ium was generally written ·eis or -z's. But
