PREFACE.

IN the text of this edition the MSS. have been followed
rather than the emendations of editors, unless there seemed
to be weighty reasons to the contrary. In placeS, how-
ever, where A is certainly corrupt, the testimony of Donatus
or other Scholiasts as to readings earlier than those in the
Calliopian MSS. has been sometimes accepted, when sup-
ported by intrinsic probability. In all but a few cases the
limits of space have precluded a full statement of the argu-
ments for and against doubtful readings, but in no instance
has a decision been made! without careful consideration of all
sides of the question.

In a School edition it has been thought better to print the
letter v, and to adopt the modernised spelling of the MSS„
except where the orthography in Terence's time was de-
monstrably different: e.g. 0 is substituted for u after another
u or v ; quor, quoius, quoi, eto, appear sor cur, cuius, cui, ete„
and -τζς for -es in the accusative plural of such words of the
third declension as form the genitive plural in -z'um.

As regards the spelling of verbs or adjectives compounded
with prepositions no rigid uniformity has been observed,
because none existed in ‘the republican period. Assimilation
took place in the commonet wordS‚ and in certain com-
binations of letters (e.g. m and p), much earlier than in

0* others· Accordingly conradz‘lur is read, but comparatum
