NOTES. LINES 482—506. 143

logi, Gr. λόγοι, ‘ mere tattle.’ The purer Latin of Terence admits
sar fewer foreign words than we find in Plautus, and we never meet with
actual Greek words, such as οἴχεται, παῦσαι, ἐπιθήκη, πάλιν, all of which
occur in the Trinummus.

494. somnia, ‘ moonshine.’ Cf. 874.

495. cantilenam eandem oanis, ‘ you are singing the same old
song,' or ‘ you are always harping on the same string.'

496. garri modo, ‘ chatter away3' modo strengthens the Imperative.

497. adeon . . . esse . . . τα Cf. 153 note.

500. ut phaleratis dictis etc. ‘that you can lead me on with your
“ tinsel and spangle,'’ and lead away my girl for nothing.’

phaleratis, from phalerae, Gr. φάλαρα, horses' tmppings, or deco-
rations like medals worn by soldiers3 so the adjective = ‘ornamented,'
‘fine.'

ducas. A similar sense of ducere is found, And. 180, 644.

501. miseritum est, ‘poor fellow.' The full phrase is found Pl.
Trin. 430 mc eius miserztum est. The tense here seems to be an imi-
tation of the so· -‘called immediate’ Aorist in Greek. In English we
should use the Present, ‘I pity him?

veris vincor, ‘it is all too true!
quam uterque est similis sui, ‘how true to his character each is,'
i. e. ‘ How like Antipho! how like Phaedria !’

502-3. neque . . . malum! ‘ to think that this trouble did not besal
me at a time when Antipho might have been beset by some other (i.e.
slighter) anxiety.’ Phaedria laments that this supreme disaster—viz.
the threatened loss of his lady-love——should be impending just when
Antipho's attention is ,engrossed by a similar complication. At any
other time, when Antipho's cares would have been of a less absorbing
nature, he might have been of more service to his brother. The above
seems to give a perfectly good sense without tampering with the text or
doing violence to the construction. Wagner, however, changes neque
to atque ; Zeune supposes vellem to be understood after neque ; Sta11-,
baum considers neque alia as = eadem ; Paumier conjectures aeque for
neque.

autem is often added like Gr. δή as an emphatic particle, especi-
ally in questions where some reproach is implied. Cf. 601, 775, 788.

504. quoi quod amas domi est, ‘ you who have at home the object
of your love.’

505. Connect cum malo huius modi and translate, ‘and has never
experienced the shock of a trouble like this ;’ conflictaris = conflictaverz's ,·
cf. And. 93 nam qui cum ingeniis conflictatur eius modi.

506. auribus teneo lupum. A wolf's ears are short. Donatus ‘
