his daughter afterwards married a Roman knight.

In personal appearance Terence is said to have been of
middle height, with a slight figure and reddish-brown hair. Of
his character we know nothing, save what can be gathered from
his prologues. These indicate a lack of independence and con-
fidence. He evidently feels that he is not a popular poet. He

Gontrast of Plautus and Terence. The sensitive prote'ge'

of broad-minded liberality, and their simple unaffected style, the
