1 30 PHORMJO.

> 272. quin follows the idea of ‘ prevention ’ contained in non causam
dico. Cf. 209 note.

276—7. adimunt diviti . . . addunt pauperi. This would have been
more likely at Athens than at Rome.

280. tua iusta, ‘the rights of your case?

tute. Cf. 172 note.

281-2. functus adulescentuli est Officium liberalia, ‘he acted
like an ingenuous youth.’ Fungor govems the Ace. in Plautus and
Terence, except in Ad. 603 tuo officio fueras functus, where the MSS.
give the Abl. Conversely fruor is constructed with the Abl. in Terence,
except in Heaut. 401, where the Acc. is found: similarly utor takes an Abl.
except in Ad. 815, but abutor an Acc. For potior cf. 469 note. Lucre-
tius constructs fungor, fruor, potior with Acc.; abutor with Acc. and Abl.

284. timidum. Antipho being really of a timid nature, cf. 204 sqq.,
this statement sounded plausible enough.

obstupefecit. When preceded by a short syllable the e in com-
pounds of this class is usually shortened, following the analogy of the
‘ Iambic Law,' p. 27, but Catullus 64. 361 has tepefaciet.

289. iarn dudum . . . audio, ‘I have been hearing you for some

time ; ⁵ cf. Fr. depuis longtemps je vous entend.
dudum may refer to time past, immediate or distant3 e. g. 537, 786,
8 38 ‘just now‚’in Pl. Trin. quam dudum ,ἵε ‘how long ago ’θ’ Cf. 459‚471 .

290. horune=lzorum-ce, cf. 58 note.

292. servom hominem, ‘one who is a slave ; ’ both homo and mulier
are often thus used in apposition. At Athens the evidence of slaves was
only taken under torture, at Rome not at all against their masters, except
in certain specified cases.

293. dictio. Verbal substantives in -io are sometimes followed by
the same case as the verb: e. g. Andr. 44 exprobratio est inmemori.
Still more remarkable is the use of the Acc. by Plautus after receptae,
curatio, tactio (very often after the last).

mitto. Cf. 2 32.

294. do is Fleckeisen’s emendation for addo or adde. It gives a better
sense and seems necessary for the mette.

297, dotem daretis, Cf. 125 note, and for the tense 108 note.

298. qua ratione, ‘ on what account.’ There is a play on the word
ratio which Demipho uses as ‘ reason,' Geta as ⁴ a money account.’ Cf.
Pl. Trin. 418-9 2— “

LE. lVequaquam argenti ratio comparet tamen.
S'I'. Ratio quidem hercle adparet: argentum οἴχεται.
dffirat. In this verb ee is scanned by Synizesis as ἔ by Vergil,
Catullus, etc., as well as by Terence.
