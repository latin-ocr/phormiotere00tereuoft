shall remam, say they what they will: ' i. e. Phormio will prevent the old ¹

to the purchase of Phaedria's lady-love.

Aer V. SCENE 1 [8].

On the reappearance of Chremes and Demipho from their interview
with Phanium, Phormio puts his new scheme into execution. He comes
to fulfil his engagement like a ‘ man of honour.’ Demipho makes very
lame excuses to annul the eompact and demand back the thirty minae.
The parasite affects righteous indignation. He has already paid away
the money, and broken off his engagement in order to marry Phanium.
1f now this is not to be, the dowry at least must remain with him as
satisfaction for the false position in which their indecision has placed him.
Demipho waxes very angry and threatens summary justice; whereupon
Phormio discloses his knowledge of the Lemnian intrigue. Chremes is
utterly crushed. His brother urges him to make a clean breast of the
affair to Nausistrata, and promises his mediation. Stung almost to frenzy
by Phormio’s taunts‚ Demipho tries to drag him off to the law-court. The

parasite on his side attempts to get to the door of Chremes' house. ¹

There ensues a violent struggle, ended by the appearance of Nausistrata,
who has heard the stentorian shouts of Phormio.

894. gratias habeo atque ago. The regular usage was to say
gratiam habeo, but gratias ago.

certainly misplaced by a copyist's error.

898. dilapidat, ‘pitches away,’ sc. like stones, ‘makes dueks and
drakes of it: ' not found elsewhere in any classical writer.
