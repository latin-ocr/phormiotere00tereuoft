if not expressed‚ e. g. 3393 but naturally -ne is not used if the clause

begins with non, e. g. 232-3.
redisse. For the spelling see 35 note, 460, etc.
qm· mihi consultum optume velit esse, ⁶ though he is anxious

for my best interests‚’ a common phrase, consultum esse being used im-

personally. qui is here concessive.

154. ut«, repeated from line above. The clause patrem ut extimescam

should be taken before qui mihi etc.

ubi in mentem eius adventi venit, ‘ when a thought of his
arrival has occurred to me.’ This construction of venire in mentem
with a Genitive is not unfrequent in Cicero, e. g. Sull. 6. 19 cum matro-
narum ac virginum veniebat z‘n mentem. The phrase is almost equiva-
lent to meminisse in meaning and so takes the same construction. , It
may be impersonal as here, or personal with the subject thought of in
the nominative, as Liv. 8. 5 non venit z'n mentem pugna apud Regillum
lacum. Cf. Madv. 5 291 , obs. 3. All MSS. give venit, except that the
late con-ector of A has introduced an A, whence most editors read
veniat. When ubi is used of indefinite frequency the Subjunctive
naturally follows3 but in this oese Antipho may well be supposed to
be thinking of the present occasion only.

adventi, archaic for adventas. In early Latin the Gen. of this
declension ended in -uis, e. g. Heaut. 287 anuis. This was contracted
(a) into -as‚ (b) into ἐπ’, the lightly pronounced s being first dropped,
and then -ui shortened to -i. Only the form -as is employed by
Augustan writers, but Ennius, Lucretius, Plautus, and Terence use both
forms side by side. We find in Terence adventi, domi, fructi, ornati,
quaesti, tumulti. N either Plautus nor Terence ever write domas.

155. quod, ‘whereas,’ both here and 157 quod is an Aee. of respect,
loosely used as a connective particle, a characteristic idiom of comic
diction: e. g. 263, 1052—3, etc.

ut par fuit, ‘ as was right ;’ par is so used by Cicero.

156. quid istuc Ρ ‘what do you mean by that?’ The MSS. give
quid istuc est? and conscius sis, both cannot be kept on account of the
mette, and it seemed less violent to omit est than to alter sis to es.

qui, causal, ‘ seeing that you.' Cf. 471.

157. quod. Cf. 155 note, Cic. Fam. 14. 4. 1 quod utinam minus
vitae cupidi fuissemus ; and for z‘d following quod Andr. 258 quod sz'
ego rescissem id prius, etc.

utinam ne. Cicero uses both ne and non after utinam.
158. neu is for ct ne, as neque is for et non.
neu cupidum eo inpulisset, ‘ and had not urged on my desires to
that act ι ’ eo lit. ⁴ thither‚’ i. e. to the marriage. Cf. 201.
