24 INTRODUCTION.

in his dealings with the young men, which redeem his rascality
from utter baseness. He may be a rogue, but he is no hypocrite,
like Chremes.

Antipho and Phaedria are rather common-place, and, unlike
Aeschinus and Ctesipho in the Adelphi, are very similar in
character. Both are frank and affectionate, but entirely wanting
in mental ballast or moral principle, the slaves of their passions
and mere puppets in the hands of Phormio, or even of the
servant Geta.

On the other hand, the personality of the two old gentlemen
is sharply drawn and skilfully worked out. Demipho is an
irascible miser, with a domineering disposition which ill brooks
contradiction, and a love of money which made him ready to
expose his brother to public shame rather than submit to the
loss of thirty minae.

Chremes is a life-like portrait of a weak and hen-pecked
husband. He has no more principle than his son, and much
less honesty. For sixteen years he had been practising a
criminal deception upon his wife, but he shows no contrition for
his abominable conduct, only fear forits detection, and richly
deserves the unenviable position in which we leave him.

Nausistrata is a strong-minded shrew, who despised and
persecuted her feeble husband, but she seems to have been
liberal enough in advancing a large sum to Demipho, nor does
she grudge it to Phaedria when she learns the truth. The
violence of her temper affords the only extenuation for the
infidelity of Chremes, and brings dramatic retribution on her
own head.

Of the other characters little need be said. Dorio enjoys the
unenviable reputation of being the most repulsive and rascally
slave-dealer in Roman Comedy: Geta is faithlessly faithful
in helping the young men to cheat his master: Sophrona has
the usual characteristic of old nurses depicted by Terence,
devoted attachment to her mistress: the ‘ advocates ’ are con-
cisely‚ though unintentionally‚ humorous.

Artistically considered the Phormio occupies a middle place
