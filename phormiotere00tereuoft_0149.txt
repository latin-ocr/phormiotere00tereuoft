factum. Cf. 315 note.

525. haee, sc. the date on which the other purchaser appeared.

526. vanitatis, ‘ bad saith? The quality most prized by the Romans
was gravitas, a solidity of character on which full relianee could be
placed. Opposed to this was vanitas, ‘fickleness,’ ‘ untrustworthiness.’

dum ob rem, ‘if it is to pay.’ In a similar sense we find in rem
And. 546, and ex re 969, in an opposite sense ab re Pl. Trin. 238.

527. sie sum: etc. ‘ 'Tis my way. If you like it, deal with me?

528. immo enimvero, ‘ nay,‘in very truth.’

5 32· dare se dixit=daturum se dixit. We find several instances in
Terence where a Pres. Inf. is used instead of a Future Inf„ e. g. And.
379, 411, 613, infra 837. Compare the use of the Pres. Ind. sor the
Fut. Ind„ 447 note. The continuative force of the Present makes it in
these cases almost equivalent to a F uture.

533. mea lege utar, etc. ‘I will follow my rule, “first pay, first
serve.’' ⁸

Aer ΙΙ. SCENE 6. [III. 3.]

Phaedria, in despair, implores the aid of Geta, who eventually under-
takes by some means to procure the money in time.

535. The scansion is doubtful. It might be quoi mimis Ι nihilo est Ι
quod hi‘c si Ι pote su Ι isset Ι etc., or quoi mi Ι nus nihi Ι lo est quod
Ιιῖι· Ι si pote Ι fuisset Ι etc. Wagner lengthens quod, making the third
foot quod hic, but this is improbable.

hic si . . . exorarier, ‘ if only he could have been wheedled out of
this three days’ grace.’ In this passage si is not strictly conditional,
but expresses a wish, exactly as in the corresponding English idiom.
pote. Cf. 379 note.

536. triduom hoe. Verbs like exorare, which take a double Acc.
in the Aetive, retain one Ace. in the Passive, the other becoming the
Subject.

fuerat, Indicative because the promise was a fact, cf. 513.
537. dudum. Cf. 289 note.
dixti. Cf. 198 note.
adiuerit=adiuverit. The metre shows that adiuerit most nearly
represents the pronunciation.

538. quin. Cf. 209.

539. equidem, from quidem, eompounded with the intensive particle
e, as in ecastor, edepol, enim, and perhaps edurus. It does not stand for
ego quidem, and, though more common with the first person singular, is
also found with other persons and numbers: e. g. Eun. 956 atque
equidem orante, ut ne hoc faceret, Thaide ; Pl. Pers. 2. 2. 5 equidem si
