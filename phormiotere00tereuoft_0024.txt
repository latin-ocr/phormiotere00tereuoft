are left at Athens in charge of Demipho’s confidential slave
Geta.

Act Ι. In the opening scenes Geta narrates his experiences

to his friend Davus. Finding it impossible to control a pair of
wild youths, he gives up the attempt, and lets them follow their
own devices.
' Phaedria first falls violently in love with a music-girl, who
turns out afterwards to be an Athenian citizen, but who is now
in the hands of a slave-dealer, Dorio, on sale for thirty minae
(Amo). As Phaedria has no money, he can do nothing but
escort his ,lady-love to and from the school where she is com-

his father’s wrath, and he pours forth his troubles (Sc. 3) into
the unsympathetic ears of his cousin, who considers that he
himself is alone deserving of pity. Geta now (Sc. 4) brings the
news of Demipho‘s arrival. Antipho cannot be induced to face
his father, and runs away, leaving Phaedria‘ and Geta to fight his
battles for him.

Both do their best to calm down the irascible old gentlernan,
who comes on (Sc. 5) fuming at the news of his son’s unauthor-
ised marriage. In spite of all that can be said, Act I closes with
