26 INTROD UCTJON.

(b) Iambic Tetrameter Aeataleotic‚ called octonarius ,
from its eight complete feet. (1 16. ) ·

(c) Iambic Tetrameter catalectie‚ called septenarius
from its seven complete feet. (57)

(d) Iambic Dimeter Aeataleetic‚ or Quaternariue. (3.)

These lines consist in their pure form of iambi3 but the
spondee, tribrach, anapaest‚ and dactyl are admitted in all feet
except the last, which must be an iambus, unless, of course, the
verse is catalectic. Moreover, as the Tetrameter is regarded'
as being composed of two verseS, with the division after the

fourth foot‚ that foot is usually an iambus3 and such words ,

as ego, tibi, cedo, are· allowed to stand there as if at the end
of a senarius. In any iambic metre an anapaest is occasionally
resolved into a Proceleusmatic (υυυυ), which is most commonly
in the first soot, and composed of two distinct pairs of syllables.

ΙΙ. TROCHAIC.

(a) 'I'roehaie 'I'etrameter Aoataleetie‚ or octonarius, (19.)
(b) Trochaic 'Petrameter catalectie, or septenarius. (237.)

(c) Trochaic Dimeter Cataleetie. (2.)

These lines consist in their pure form of trochees; the
spondee, tribrach, anapaest, and dactyl are also admitted. But
only the trochee, tribrach, and sometimes dactyl are found in
the seventh foot of the Septenarius ; and the eighth foot of the
Octonarius is always a trochee or spondee. In Trochaic Sep-
tenarii the last syllable is always considered as long: cf. 318,
319, 321. Trochaic, like Iambic Tetrameters, are considered to
be divided after the fourth foot‚ but in neither metre is this
division constantly observed. As the Trochaic metre is more
quick and lively than the Iambic, it is naturally employed in
scenes where strong feeling and excitement are represented.

Besides the above, 485 is an irregular line, apparently con-
sisting of one trochee with a syllable over.
