in the scheme to get the required money.

Acr ΙΙἸ. SCENE 3. [IV. 3.]

Geta now puts his scheme into execution. He tells Demipho and
Chremes that in their interest he has sounded Phormio, and has found
him open to the following arrangement. On receipt of thirty minae the
parasite will give up all legal proceedings and marry Phanium himself.
To this Chremes scarcely persuades his brother by offering to provide
the money from his wife's income.

607. expecto, ‘ Ι am waiting to see.’
