162 PHORMIO.

Ac‘r IV. SCENE 6. [V. 6.]

Lemnian daughter and her identity with Phanium. All this he relates to
Phormio and Phaedria.

841. 0 Fortuna, Ο Fors Fortuna, ‘ O luck! O great good luck ! ’
Fors Fortuna, the goddess of good luck, had a' separate temple on the
right bank of the Tiber distinct from that of Fortuna : the verbs there-
fore are plural. The Asyndeton is natural in such exeited speech.

842. meo ero, Dat. co’mmodi.

843. quidnam hic sibi volt Ρ ‘whatever does the fellow mean? ' a
colloquial phrase frequent in Terence. The ordinary meaning of velle
aliquid alicui is ‘to want’ or ‘to wish something for some one.' Cf.

own injury.’

umerum. Cf. 39 note.

panio. Slaves out of doors sometimes wore a coarse outer gar·-
ment, the lower sold of which would be thrown over the shoulder when
they wanted to make haste.

845. contigerint. We should have expected ut quae contigerint
sciat, or ut haec quae contzgerunt sciat. The Subjunctive may perhaps
depend on the idea of the character of the news to be imparted rather
than the mere fact.

847. em tibi! ‘there you are again! ' Cf. 52 note.

848. It seems to have been a common practical joke to delay slaves
when in a hurry in order to get them into trouble. It is a stock incident
in Terentian comedy. Cf. 195.

849. pergit hercle, ‘ he's going on, by Jove.'

numquam tu odio tuo me vinces, ‘you will never get the better
of me by boring me.'

verbero. Cf. 684.

851. familiariorem,‘ one of the family? Cf. 721.

852. actutum, ‘ immediately,’ common in Plautus, but occurs only
once each in Cicero and Livy.

853. O is elided. See Introduction, p. 31.

quantum est qui vivont. , ‚Cfi the common phrase quicquid est
deorum. Tr. ¹ the happiest man alive?
homo hominum, thus doubled for the sake of emphasis.
