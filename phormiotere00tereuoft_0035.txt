ACCIDENCE ΛΝΒ SYNTAX. 31

separated by a consonant may be contracted into a single
syllable. This is* most common in the case of pronouns and
deuS, e. g. Wm, tzTo‘m, mZbrum, thS, cuz—us, αἲξ-03)· but we also
find rchere 18, msa—o 193, elz-utius 182, dicas 754, dehortatics=
dortatus 910, quo—ad 148, etc. Sometimes a word made mono-
syllabic by synizesis is then elided‚ e. g. meum 232. In Terence
dehinc and proin are always of one syllable, antehac of two. On
the contrary, nunc iam is always scanned as mindam, and is
printed accordingly (diaeresis). Augustan poets employ Synizesis
sparingly, chiefly in making consonantal ί or u, as abiete, ariete
=abjete, arjete,· tenuia=tenvia, and in cases of nouns or ad-
jectives ending in -eus, &gaurai

IV. Hiatus is admitted,

(1) when there is a change of speaker, e. g. 146, 542, 963 ;

(2) when the line is broken by a strong pause, e. g. Ad.
5743

(3) after an interjecti0n‚ e. g. 411, 753, 803.

Note, however, that O may be elided‚ e. g. 259, 360, 853, and
apparently Au 754. Occasionally a long final vowel, or a vowel
before m, is shortened and not elided‚ e. g. qui aget 27, ηέ agas
419, te‘ {dem 426 probably, qudm ego 808, εἴ habet 1041. Cf. 383,
501, 883, 911, 954, 982, 1005. Lucretius has eleven instances of

this (see Munro's note on 2. 404), Vergil six, e. g. Ecl. 8. 108 an
qul amant. Cf. Madw, 502 b.

ACCIDENCE AND SYNTAX OF THE
PHORMIO.

The following is a brief synopsis of the leading peculiarities
in the Accidence and Syntax of Terence, as exemplified in this
Play, The references are to the notes, where the various points
are treated in detail. Some cases are here mentioned not un-

known in Augustan Latin‚'but which are specially characteristic
of Terence’s style.
