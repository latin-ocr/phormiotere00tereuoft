of these forms. In the,present passage it is quite an open question (cf.
681 note), but faxo is often used where a Fut. simple would naturally
stand, and in Ad. 847—8 is a direct co-ordinate offuciam Fut. The
Subiunctive form is never used as a Perf.‚ but always as a Fut. Subj.;
cf. the common phrase dz' faxint expressive of a wish, Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 38
cave saxis, and the use of ausim. Vergil, Livy, Ovid, and Horace
occasionally employ these forms, and dz' faxint is found even in Cicero.
Cf. 742 note. As regards construction faxo is followed four times in
'Terence by the Fut. Ind.‚ here, 1055, Eun. 285, 663, thrice by the Pres.
Subj., Ad. 209, 847 (placed after the Subj.)‚ and Andr. 854. It is also
constructed with an Ace. and a Perf. Part. Pass., infra 1028. There is
no certain instance of the Fut. Ind. after faxo in Plautus, and the
Augustan writers always use the Subjunctive construction.

foris, ‘out,’ an Abl. plur. of the obsolete fira, used as an adverb
meaning ‘rest out of doors: ’ so fhras= ‘motion out of doors.’

309. adduc. Terence always uses duc in the simple form, but in
composition either —duce or -duc. A always gives the shorter form
if the metre does not require the longer, except in Heaut. 744
TRADVCEHVC: conversely the later MSS. always read the longer form
except for metrical reasons, e. g. Eun. 377, and one MS. F which gives
traduc in Heaut. 744. Of the other Imperatives, fac, dic, fir, Plautus
sometimes writes dz'ce, duce, never fere, and in both the comic poetssace
often appears, but only at the end of lines, e. g. 397, 674. Otherwise
Terence uses the shortened forms. The rule in Augustan fLatin was
to use exclusively dic, duc, fer, sac, and similarly in the compounds of
duco, fero, and those of facio which retain a in the stem; but other
compounds of facio and those of dico retain the final e : e. g. educ, affir,
calefac, but confice, edice.

311. The order is, Ego devertar hinc domum salutatum deos penatis.

313. adsient, archaic for adsint. Terence uses siem, sies, siet, sient :

also possiem, possiet, adsz'et. Cf. 446, 508, 514, 635, 675, 773, 806, 822.
314. ut ne. Cf. 168 note.

ACT ΙΙ. SCENE 1 [2].

In the interval between the Acts Geta has met Phormio and informed
him of the arrival and the anger of Demipho. Phormio is confident
that he can carry the matter through3 he boasts of the impunity with
which he has preyed upon the wealthier citizens, and describes the
delightful freedom from anxiety enjoyed by a parasite.

315. itane . . . ais, is more emphatic than ain (ais-ne): sometimes
the expression is further strengthened by tandem, e. g. 2 31. Tr. ‘ Do
you mean to say ’ etc. The metre requires pdtris or az‘s.
