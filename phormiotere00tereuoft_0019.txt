Suetonius'relates that when this play was offered to the Aediles,
the young author was told to submit it to the judgment of
Caecilius, Terence arrived when ›the veteran poet was at supper,
and being in mean attire was seated on a stool near the table.
But he had read no more than a few lines, when Caecilius bade
him take a place upon his couch‚ and bestowed high commenda-
tion on the play. As Caecilius died in 168 B.C., the Andria

Ambivius Turpio, secured it a hearing at all. The Heauton

enemies. According to one account 1 he perished by shipwreck

of Menander’s comedies translated into Latin. A more general
belief was that he died at Stymphalu8‚ in Arcadia, from grief on
hearing of the loss of his MSS„ which he had sent on before

- him by sea. Porcius Licinus narrates that his noble patrons
suffered him to die in such abject poverty that he had not even
a lodging at Rome whither a slave might have brought news of
his death. This is probably untrue, for Suetonius writes that he
