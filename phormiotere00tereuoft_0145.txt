'⁸ from your assurances t ’ fides meaning either ‘belief ’ or that which
produces belief, i. e. ‘ promises‚' ‘ oaths.

poteretur. This form is preferred by Terence to potiretur, as
also potitur: indeed potitur is only use once by a classieal writer,
Ον. Her. 14. 113. Terence constructs potior three times with an Ace„
once with an Abl., infra 830. Cf. Ad. 871, 876. The Augustan con-
struction is the Abl., rarely the Gen. except in the phrase potiri rerum.

471. iam dudum. Cf. 289 note.

qui abieris, ‘ for your flight : ’ qui is causal.

474. subolet, lit. ‘it emits a smell for one‚’ so ‘one gets wind of‚’
‘has an inkling of: ⁷ used impersonally or with a neuter pronoun as
subject; only in Plautus and Terence. Cf. Pl. Trin. 615, 698.

nil etiam, ‘nothing at all: ' etiam is often thus used as an inten- =
sive. Cf. 542.
475. nisi, ‘ but.’ Cf. 95 3. This usage seems to be only colloquial.
cessavit eniti, '‘slackened his exertions:’ cessare = ‘to flag‚'
desinere= ‘to desist.'

praebuit, sc. se.

477. confutavit . . . senem, ‘ he utterly quenched the old gentleman
when boiling over with rage: ' confutare, lit. ‘to pour cold water into
a vessel which is boiling over.'

478. ego quod potui porro. In full the sentence would be, ego
porro fici quod potui facere.

480. quid eum? ‘what about him? ' In conversational language
an Ace. may be thus loosely used with no verb expressed and probably
with none understood. The essential idea of the Acc. is ‘limitation‚'
and so an Acc. may be thus employed to limit the question to the
person or thing spoken about. Cf. 755.

aibat=aiebat. Terence seems to have used —ibam or —iebam for
the Imperf. of the fourth conjugation indifferently‚ e. g. Andr. 38
servibas ; Phor. 83 serviebat. The shorter form was sometimes
employed by later poets, e. g. lenibaet, nutribant, vestibat by Vergi13
audibat, mollibat by Ovid. Az‘bam, etc„ probably represents the
colloquial pronunciation in the time of Terence. The MSS. are so
confused on this point that the reading has usually to be decided by
the metre.

481. The construction is a mixture of ut aibat, de eius consilio volo
facere, and aibat de eius consilio sese velle facere. Cf. Ad. 648 ut
opinor eas non nosse te.

de eius consilio, ‘ in accordance with his advice : ' cf. the common
phrases de more, de sententia.
