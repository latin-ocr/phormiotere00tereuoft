716. opus facto est. Cf. 440 note.

lubido, ‘ caprice.’

717. si . . . instabit, ‘ if that other girl (cf. 657) puts more pressure
on him.'

719. ut conveniat hano, ‘to visit her,' i. e. Phanium. This is the
classical construction of convenire in the above sense.

720. The order is dicat nos dare eam nuptum (Supine) Phormioni.

721. familiarior, ‘ more intimately connected.’ Cf. 851.

723. malum, ‘the plague;’ thus used interjectionally‚ cf. Ad, 544
quid hoc, malum, infilz‘cz‘tatz‘s ‚2 infra 948 and 976 where there is a rela-
tive clause appended.

quid tua id refert Ρ ‘ what does it matter to you? ' Interest and
refert take a Gen. of the person, but with pronouns the cases med, tuci, sud,
nostrd, vestrd. The probable origin of this construction is as follows:
tuam rem fert, Balbi inter rem est, the m being always liable to be
dropped (cf. 546 note), become tua re-fert, Balbi interest. No other
theory explains so completely the cases med, tud, etc„ the Gen. of the
person, and the quantity of reffert.

725. quoquo is an almost certain interpolation, as shown by the
mette. The mistake perhaps arose from wrongly giving v. 724 to
Chremes (as is done in A), who would not be likely to speak of himself ,
as te, and the suggestion was in no way Demipho's.

726. mulier . . . convenit, ‘ one woman gets on better with
another.’

727. mas, sc. his wife and daughter from Lemnos, cf. 571-2.

AcT III. SCENE 6. [V. 1.]

Chremes is startled by the sudden appearance of Sophrona, a servant
of hisLemnian wife, from Demipho's house. He learns from her the
death of her mistress and the marriage of Phanium to Antipho. At
first he fails to identify his own daughter with Phormio’s ward, and
thinks that his nephew like himself must have married two wives : but
the confusion is soon removed and his joy is unbounded.

730. suasum, ‘ advice‚’ only ante· and post-Classical.
732. nam quae = quaenam, ‘ why? who?’ ⁴
a fratre, ‘ from my brother’s house : ' a common idiom, e. g. 795, etc.
733. infirmas, ‘ insecure,’ because divorce was so easy, and parental
authority so great, that no marriage could be safely depended on with-
out the father’s consent.

735. edepol, ‘ by Pollux‚’ shorter form pol 747. The prefix is from the

“ interjection e, as in e-cast0r‚ and perhaps a syncopated vocative of deus.
