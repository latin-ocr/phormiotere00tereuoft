ROMAN COMEDY AND TERENCE. 17

easy yet pointed dialogue, the terse and dramatic descn'ptions,
and the admirable delicacy of the portrayal of character, won ν
” from the cultured taste of the Augustan age a more favourable
verdict¹ than could have been expected from the rude and
unlettered masses who most enjoyed the broad fun of a bois-
terous farce. The above characteristics secured sor Terence
considerable attention at the Renaissance in Europe. In England
several of the minor dramatists are under obligations to him,
while in France his influence profoundly affected Moliere, and
is in no small degree responsible for the long· c-ontinued servitude
of the French drama to the‘ unities’ of time and place which
have so cramped its free development.

As might beexpected, the characters in Terence, though
admirably drawn, are rather commonplace. No personality in
his plays stands out in the memory like that of Tyndarus in the
Captivi, or Stasimus in the Trinummus. Two old men, one
irascible and the other mild, both usually the dupes of their sons
and an intriguing slave3 two young men, one of strong character
and the other weak, both amorous and somewhat unscrupulous
as to the means of gratifying their passion3 a dignified and
elderly gentleman3 an anxious mother; a devoted servant3 a
rascally slave dealer: these form the stock characters of Teren-
tian comedy and recur with somewhat wearisome monotony.
Nor does the standard of morality rise above a conventional

¹ Afranius writes :

Terentio non similem dices quempiam.
Cicero writes:

T u quoque, qui solus lecto sermone, Terenti,
Conversum expressumque Latina voce [Menandrum
In medium nobis sedatis vocibus effers,

Quidquid come loquens atque omnia dulcia dicens.

Horace, Ep. 2. 1. 59, records the general verdict:

dicitur . . .
Vincere Caecilius gravitate, Terentius arte.

Volcatius, on the other hand, places Terence below Naevius, Plautus,
y Caecilius, Licinius, and Atilius.
