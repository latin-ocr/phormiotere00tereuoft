1 36 PHORMJO.

365. interea, ‘ during that time.'

366. The order is, narrabat hunc cognatum suom neglegere se.

367, quem ego viderim etc. ‘ the most worthy man perhaps that Ι
have seen in my life.' The Subjunctive probably qualifies what would
otherwise be a downright statement, as is done in English by ‘ per-
haps.'

368. videas te atque illum, ut nar-rae, ‘ compare yourself and him
according to your account‚' i. e. ‘ what a contrast between such an excel-
lent man as you describe and a rascal like yourself.' The meaning must
be uncomplimentary to account for Phormio’s rejoinder. Some explain
this, ‘ do you see to your stories about yourself and him, it is nothing to
us : ' or, ‘ see what lies you are telling about yourself and him.'
Bentley’s version, vidisti nullum ut narras, has the merit of sim·
plicity.

i in malam crucem! ‘ go and be hanged.’ Gr. ἔρρ’ ἐς κόρακας.
Cf. 930 i hinc z'n malam rem.

369. nam etc. This follows immediately on 367, Phormio disre-
garding Geta's interruption.

370. hanc, i. e. Phanium. Note the scansion ὅό hdnc i‘ni' Ι miciti' Ι ds
ete. Cf. Introd. on Metres.

373. tandem. Cf. 231 note.

career, ‘ jail—bird!

374. extortor . . . distortor, ‘ you rascally robber, you pettisogging
rogue.' ·

378. adulescens, ‘ my young gentleman.'

abs te. Cf. 188 note.
bona venia, ‘ with your kind leave.’

379. potis est, ‘it is possible : ' potis may refer to a subject (rarely
plural) of any gender, or may be used impersonally. The neuter pote is
similarly employed, e. g. 5 35, but, unlike potis, is generally found with-
out est. As a rule potis stands before vowels, pote before consonants.
N either potis nor pote occurs in Augus-‚tan prose.

380. tuom . . . istum. The addition of istum emphasises tuom, and
gives moreover a contemptuous turn to the phrase.

381. qui, ‘how3' cf. 123 note.

diceret. The regular sequence of tenses would require dixerit. It
is perhaps to be explained by the preceding fuisse which carries back
the thought to past time, though grammatically the verb is of course
dependent on explana.

382. nossem? Cf. 122 note.

383. ego me nego, sc. nosse (novisse).

tu, qui ais, ‘ do you, who make the assertion.’
