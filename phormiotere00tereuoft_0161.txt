NOTES. LJNES 7 36-772. 157

ambiguity in omitting gnatam, which some editors substitute for amari
the reading of A.

761. haec sola, sc. Sophrona. The reading is doubtful. If hic solus
be right, Antipho must be meant.

762. quid. opus facto sit. Cf. 440 note.

763. oppido. Cf. 317.

765. scibit. Terence uses scibo for Ist pers, scies for 2nd pers.
(except in Heaut. 996 and perhaps Eun. 805), scibit for 3rd pers.

The MSS. read sequere me .· ‘cetera intus (or intus cetera) audies,
which will not scan. The insertion of tu seems more satisfactory than
to change audies to audiemus or audietis. The line then becomes an
Octonarius, as the last line of Ad. 4. 5 (712), which also follows
Septenarii.

ACT IV. SCENE 1. [V. 2.]

Demipho returns from paying the money to Phormio in a very ill-
temper‚ which is not improved by Geta's expression of doubt as to the
fulfilment of the compaet. Geta himself is by no means easy with
regard to his own prospects of escaping punishment.

766. nostrapte. Cf. 172.
ut malos expediat esse, ‘ that it pays to be a rogue ; ' cf. Heaut.
388 expedit bonas esse vobis.

767. diei nos bonos studemus. Note that in Augustan Latin a
predicative word following an Infin. and referring to a subject in the
Nom. is itself in the N om„ e. g. Bibulus studet fieri consul. Cf. Madv.

768. ita fugias, ne praeter oasam, sc. fugias, ‘in running away,
don't pass the house’ (i. e. your master's); a proverb applicable to a
runaway slave, something like ‘don't jump out of the frying-pan into
the fire,’ οι· ‘in escaping from Scylla don't fall into Charybdis? Demipho
means that in trying to get out of one trouble he is running the risk
of a worse. Another interpretation is, ‘ in running away, don't pass
your house,’ which is the safest place for you. But the application of
this to Demipho's present circumstances is not obvious.

nonne. Cf. 119 note.

769. etiam argentum est, ultro obiectum, ‘ we have actually

thrown money to him as well,' i. e. like a sop to Cerberus. Cf. Verg.

A. 6. 420-1 melle soporatam et medicatis frugibus qffam obicit. F0r2
ultro cs. 360 note.

770. qui. Cf. 123 note.
771. qui recta prava faciunt, ‘ who eonfound right with wrong.’ ’
77²· ut, ‘ so that? Demipho continues his sentence from 771.
