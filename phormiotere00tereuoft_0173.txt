NOTES. LJNES 990-1034· 169·

(2) ‘his funeral oration is being pronounoed: a sarcastic allusion
to Demipho's feeble excuses for Chremes, which are represented as the
laudatio usually delivered at a funeral, perhaps here suggested by
sepultus sum 943, cf. 1026.

1016. tua . . . tuo, objective use.

1019. 0 medio abiit, ‘has departed.’ Cf. 16, 967 notes.

scrupulus, Cf. 954 note.

1021. quid ego aequo animo, sc. feram? ‘how ⁴can Ι bear it
calml Ρ

(3111110 . . . defungier, ‘ Ι sorely wish that this is now the end.'

defungier used as an impersonal Passive, as in Ad. 507 utinam
hic sit modo defunctum.

1022. quid sperem? ‘what can Ι hope for?' Fleckeisen's conjec*
ture, qui id sperem, ‘ how can Ι hope for it,’ is very plausible.

1024. magis expetenda, ‘ more attractive.’

1026. exequias Chremeti . . . ire, a formula used in giving notice
of a funeral. Note the omission of the preposition before exequias.

1027. sie dabo, ‘that's my style‚' or ‘ such shall be my revenge.'
dare = facere is common in colloquial Latin, in Lucretius and Vergil,
less frequent in Cicero and Livy. We find such phrases as dare finem,
cuneum, motus, ruz'naS, discessum, impetum, ete. :facere finem, etc.
Munro on Lucr. 4. 41 quotes Max Miiller‚ Science of Language‚ and
series, p. 224, ‘in Latin it was equally impossible to distinguish
between the roots dd 'and died, because the Romans had no aspirated
dentals; but such was the' good sense of the Romans that, when they
felt they could not efficiently keep the two roots apart‚ they kept only
one, dare, to give, and replaced the other dare, to place or to make, by
different verbs, such as ponere, facere.'

It seems possible that such uses of dare as are given above may
be survivals in popular or poetical language of dare from root diui.
cf. 974, etc.

1028. faxo. Cf. 308 note. Two MSS. read faxo tali sz‘t mactatus.

mactatum, ‘ victimised.' With this reading note hic ; cf. 266 note.

1030. habet . . . ogganniat, ‘she has something to din (lit. snarl)
into his ears as long as he lives.’ Note ᾗ.

1031. at meo merito, sc. hoc videtur factum. Cf. 1033. At first
sight it looks as if this repetition of the same phrase (1031 and 1033)
were due to some corruption of the text: but in the mouth of the
ontraged Nausistrata it is perhaps natural enough.

1033. minume gentium! ‘ not the least in the worldl’ gentium is
a partitive Genitive, cf. nusquam gentium, ποῦ γῆς, etc.

1034. fieri infectum non potest, ‘ cannot be made unmade ; ' this
