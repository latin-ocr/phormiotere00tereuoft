124 PHORMIO.

celere. This is the usual form of the adverb in Terence.
reperis, Here repperis is found in A B C D F P, reppereris in
D2 G and Priscian, repereris E. Probably reperis is the true reading,
as mistakes of this sort often occur in the MSS.; e. g. in 192 five good
MSS. read repperiam for reperiam.
180. te inpendent. A very rare construction, inpendere being
followed by Dat. or in with Ace. Cf. Lucilius ut quae res me inpendet

agatur, also Lucr. 1. 326 mare quae inpendent. Lucretius also uses
incidere and accidere with an Aecus.

181. uti, ‘ how,’ as often.

18 3. quidnam t> ‘about what?’ Aee. of limitation.

184. ‘Then I have but a moment to consider this affair.'

punctum temporis is rather a favourite phrase of Cicero. Cf.
στιγμὴ χρόνου.

185. quod, sc. Antipho's marriage.

186. laterem lavem, ‘I should be washing a brick; ’ a translation
of the Greek proverb πλίνθον πλύνεις. The meaning is. ‘it would be
worse than useless! Greek bricks were made of clay baked in the sun,
so that the more they were washed the more dirty they would become.
Cf. Xen. Hell. 5. 2. 5.

187. quom . . . tum. This sentence shows well how these con·
junctions, at first purely temporal‚ come to be used as particles of con-
nexion. Here you might translate, ‘while’ . . . ‘then,’ or ‘not only’
. . . ‘but also.’

animi is a Locative like lzumi, domi, etc.: cf. Ad. 610 discrucior
ammi.

188. nam absque eo esset, ‘sor were it not for him.’ Plautus and
Terence only use absque in the protasis of conditional sentences with si
omitted as here. In the Augustan period absque is only used in a few
quasi-juridical formulae, e. g. absque sententia, ‘without judgment.’ Cf.
Pl. Trin. 832, 1127.

absque was formed by adding -que (its copulative force being lost)
to abs, which was a collateral form of ab (cf. ἐκ, ἐξ), used before words
beginning with c, q, t. As early however as Plautus, abs is rarely found
except before te. Cicero always wrote abs te up to about Β. 0.· 55.
Oceasional uses of abs in later authors, e. g. Livy, are probably in-
tentional archaisms. In as-pello, as-porto, as—pernor (for as-spernor)‚
the b has fallen out. Cf. Pl. Pers. 159 abs chorago ; infra 201, 378,
617, 840. ν

1 89. vidissem :providissem , colloquial.

190. aliquid conwrsassem, ‘I should have packed a few things
