seven comedies and gained the prize five times, but some confusion
exists between him and another comic poet, Apollodorus of Gela.

Epifflcazomenos (Mid. voice), i.e. ‘ one who claims a girl in
marriage as next of kin? Donatus says that the real title was Ἐπιδι-
καζομένη (Pass. voice), from the girl claimed, and that the Ἐπιδικαζό-
μενος was a different play; but this seems improbable, as we should
naturally expect ἡ Ἐπιδικασθεΐσα, not ἐπιδικαζομένη. Cf. 125 note.

facta 1111, ‘produced fourth in, order,’ i.e. os Terenee’s comedies;
the abortive attempt to represent the Hecyra being apparently not
reckoned. See p. 15.

Cos. or Coss„ the usual abbreviation for Consulibus. The date was
161 Β. C. See p. 15.

Prologue.

It vhad been the custom of earlier dramatists to give a plot of the
Play in the Prologue. As dramatic art developed this was felt to be
unnecessary, and Terence only followed the example set by Plautus in
the Trinummus (if the Prologue of that play be anthemio), in making.
the various characters of the comedy unfold its story to the audience.
It was, however, an innovation either to write no Prologue at all—as at
the first representation of the Hecyra, and possibly of the Andria—or to
make the Prologue a vehicle for answering personal oriticisms and
attacking criticS. The Prologues of the six plays of Terence are all
genuine, while the twelve extant Prologues of Plautus are all spurious,
with the possible exception of that to the Trinummus.

Ι. postquam, as in Ad. 1, almost=qu0niam (quom iam), the fact
being that the ideas of sequence in time and of causality fade im-
perceptibly into each other.

poeta. vetus, i.e. Luscius Lanuvinus, his jealous rival, to whom
Terence refers in all his prologues, except that of the Hecyra-in
Heaut. 22 with the epithet malevolus. Cf. p. 15.

poetam. Terence never introduces his own name, as Plautus
sometimes does, but calls himself poetam, hunc, or hominem.

Note the alliteration, which however Terence does not use so freely
as Plautus, except in his prologues3 cf. 4, 8, 11, 14, 17, 18, 22, 23, 29.
Jordan calculates that an alliteration occurs in about every nine lines of
Plautus and twenty lines of Terence. Cf. 334.

2. studio, sc. scribendi.

4. dictitat, note the frequentative, ‘is always saying?

antehac, always scanned as two syllables in Terence.
