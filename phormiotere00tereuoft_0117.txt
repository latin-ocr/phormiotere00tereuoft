for losing money which has a parallel in English. Propertius 4. 5. 44
uses ferit in a similar sense, alluding to this passage. In Pl. Trin. 247
ibi pendentem ferit, there is a play upon the ordinary and the colloquial
meanings. ⁷

48. natalis dies, i. e. at the ἀμφιδρόμια, or name-feast, an Attic
festival, at which the child was carried round the hearth. Birthdays were
scrupulously observed among the Romans also, as occasions for gifts
and feasts. Note the proceleusmatic in the second foot3 see Introduction
on Metres‚ p. 26.

49. initiabunt, a word of doubtful meaning in this place.

(1) ‘ at his initiation‚' either to the family sacra, or to the Eleu-
sinian or other mysteries.

(2) ‘at his weaning,' because according to Varro children were
then initiated to the rite⁸s of the deities who presided over eating‚ ,
drinking, and sleeping‚ Edulz'a (or Edusa), Patiar, and Cuba.

Admission to the family sacra is on the 'whole more probable,
because the ceremony at weaning was purely Roman and so not likely
to be here alluded to, See pp. 16—7. Some editors place only a
comma after dies, supposing that the ‘ initiation ’ took place on the
birthday3 but it is more forcible to understand it as a fourth occasion
for fleecing Geta.

50. mittundi. Cf. 22 note.

causa, ‘ pretext.'

Acr Ι. SCENE 2.

to look for him. In the conversation which ensues Geta lets the
audience know the position of affairs; how impossible he had found it
to control the two young men, Antipho and Phaedria, of whom he had
been left in charge; how Phaedria had become enamoured of a music-
girl whom he was unable to purchase from her master Dorio; how
Antipho likewise had fallen a victim to the charms of a young lady
named Phanium, whom he had first seen at her mother’s funeral ; how
by Phormio's assistance a suit had been trumped up against Antipho, who
was asserted to be the next-of·kin to Phanium3 how, no defence being
made, the marriage had been hastily concluded‚ with the result that all
parties were now dreading the return of the young man’s father

, 51. rufus, ‘red-haixed.’ Davus wore a red wig. Rufus in this
sense was a cognomen of several families at Rome. The sentence is an
Aposiopesis ; cf. 110.
