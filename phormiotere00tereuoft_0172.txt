168 ’ PHORMJO.

Acr V. SCENE 2 [9].

With insolent triumph Phormio discloses to the outraged wife her
husband's infamy. Demipho tries to intercede for his wretched brother,
at first with small success. Phormio improves the occasion. He wins
from Nausistrata a practical assurance that Phaedria shall be allowed
to keep his bride, that the money paid shall not be asked for, and last,
but not least, an ‘invitation for himself to supper, to which they allgo
in as the curtain falls 1.

990. qui nominat me—? Nausistrata begins to speak while she
is scarcely out of the door. Before she has time to finish her sentence
(with homo perhaps), her eyes fall on the termination of the violent
struggle before the house, and she breaks off with an exclamation of
surprise. This explains qui, which otherwise would have been quis.
Cf. 618 note.

991. quis hie homo est P ‘ who is this fellow here? ’ Cf. 618 note.

992. hicine ut . . . respondeat. Cf. 304 note.

993. ereduas. All MSS. give credas ,· but the archaic form seems
necessary for the metre. Plautus uses creduam, creduas, creduut .· also
creduis, creduit.

994. abi. Cf. 59 note.

totus friget, ‘ all as cold as a stone,’ i. e. with fright.
998. quod, Ace. of respect. Cf. 155 note.
1001. tibi narret Ρ ‘ is he to tell the tale for you?’
factum est abs te sedulo, ‘ you have managed matters nicely.'

1005. mi homo 1 ‘ my good man ε ’

1009. hodie, ‘ in our time.'

1014. The order is non nego eum meritum esse culpam in hac re.

1015. sed ea. quin sit ignoscenda? ‘but why should that be
unpardonable?' quin = ‘why not,' cf. 209. Donatus, followed by
Bentley, considered the phrase as an Aposiopesis, negare non poteris
or the like being understood. Others repeat non nego before quin, sc.
sed non nego quin ea sit ignoscenda, which does not seem very forcible.

verba fiunt mortuo: a doubtful phrase, (1) ‘you are wasting
words on the dead ; ’ or, ‘ you might as well talk to the dead,' sc. as to
Nausistrata: cf. Pl. Bacch. 519 nihilo plus referet Quam si ad sepul-
chrum mortuo dixit logos.

¹ In Roman theatres the curtain was lowered (aulaea premere) to the
floor, or perhaps drawn under the stage at the commencement of an
Act, and raised again at the conclusion (aulaea tollere). Cf. Hor. Ep.
2. 1. 189 quattuor aut plures aulaea premuntur in horas, Verg. G. 3.
25 purpurea intexti tollant aulaea Britanni. ’
