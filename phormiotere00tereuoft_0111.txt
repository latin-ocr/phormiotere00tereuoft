NOTES.

Didascalia. The notices called διδασκαλίαι, concerning the origin

tota‚’ the change of the music corresponding to the merrier character
which the play assumed. Donatus, however, says that tibia dextra:

Claudi, sc. Servos, who composed the music for all Terence’s plays.

Graeca, i. e. Comoedia Palliata, wherein the scene and characters are
Greek, as opposed to a Comoedia Togata, in which they are Roman, or
