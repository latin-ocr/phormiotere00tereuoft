PHORMIO: PLOT AND CHARACTERS. 23

of which is fully grasped by Phormio, who retires to prepare
for the next stage of his intrigue.

Aet V opens with a stormy scene between Phormio and the
two old gentlemen. The parasite demands Phanium as his
bride in accordance with the compact, Demipho says that he
has changed his mind and insists that the thirty minae should
be refunded. Phormio indignantly refuses, and soundly reviles
them both for their childish indecision. Demipho, losing all
patience, tries to hurry Phormio off to the law-courts, whereupon
the parasite plays his trump card. He openly proclaims his
knowledge of Chremes' Lemnian family, and threatens to tell
all to Nausistrata. This brings matters to a climax: Demipho ,
and Chremes endeavour to drag Phormio away from the house
and a violent struggle ensues, which is ended by the appearance
of Nausistrata, summoned by the parasite's stentorian lungs.
Chremes, to his utter confusion, has to hear the story of his
misdeeds poured into the ears of his injured wife. Nausistrata
is wildly indignant, Phormio insolently triumphant. He invites
the public to Chremes’ ‘funeral obsequies‚' and further tells of
Phaedria’s marriage and of the trick by which the purchase
money was secured. At this news Chremes begins to fume,
but is at once set down with the crushing retort from his
imperious spouse that his son might well have one wife, if the
father had two. Demipho’s mediation at last effects a pro-
visional reconciliation. As a reward for his services, and as a
punishment to Chremes, Phormio obtains from Nausistrata an
invitation to dinner, of which he will no doubt constantly avail
himself, and they all go into the house as the curtain falls.

The story of the Play will have already indicated the main
outlines of the several characters. In naming the Play aster
Phormio, Terence showed a just appreciation of the importance
of the part. The individuality of the parasite is strongly
marked. Shrewd and unscrupulous as to means, avowedly a
‘bird of prey’ who lives on the ‘weakness or the vice of his

neighbours, he yet displays an active sympathy and bon-homie
