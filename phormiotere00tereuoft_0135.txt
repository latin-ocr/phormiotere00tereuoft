’ sumeret, sc. mutuom argentum, ‘he should have borrowed it.’
For the tense see 108 note. Cf. Verg. A. 4. 678 eadem me adfata
vocasses, ‘ you should have invited me to share your fate,' where the
context makes it almost =debebas vocare ,· ib. 8. 643 at tu dictis, Albane,
maneres,=debuz'sti manere ,⁴ Cic. pro Sulla 8. 25 ac sz', judices, ceteris
¹patriciis me et vos peregrinos videri oporteret, a Torquate tamen lzoc
vitium sileretur ; infra 468, and Heaut. 201-2 fortasse aliquantum
iniquior erat . . . pateretur, i. e. ‘ he should have borne it.’

302. dixti. Cf. 198 note. “

erederet, ‘would have given us credit? At Rome the Lex quina
vicenario (Lex Plaetoria) forbade loans to young men under five and
twenty; cf. Pl. Ps. 3033 as did also the Senatus-consultum Mace-
donianum. But it is not clear that we have here a specific allusion
to Roman law, which is against our author’s custom; ef. p. 16.

303. potest, impersonal, as often in Terence: e. g. 402, 640, 674, 818.

304. egon . . . ut patiar. Note the emphatic ego. Madvig (ξ 353
obs.) explains this construction as = fierine potest ut etc., and it is clear
that there must be an ellipse of something of the sort. Cf. 669, 874,
955, etc. Sometimes —ne is omitted, e. g. Andr. 618. Translate, ‘to
think that I should put up with her marriage with him for a single day?
Note that this construction refers to the future, mene pati to the present,
mene passum esse to the past.

305. nil suave meritum (θεώ,ι they have deserved no indulgence,
⁰ lit. ‘nothing indulgent has been deserved' sc. ‘ by them.' The Pers.
Part. Pass. of mereo is used by Cicero, Livy, etc., though not often. ’

Donatus interprets nihil mihi mercedis suave est ut ego illam cum z‘llo
nuptam feram.

commonstrarier. Cf. 92 note.

307. nompe, often scanned thus in Plautus and Terence, when the

first syllable is unaccented.1n some MSS. it is then written nepe. See
Introduction on Prosody.

308. iam faxo hic aderit, ‘ Ι will fetch him here at once?

faxo. Plautus and Terence use the following: saxo (Ind.), faxim
(Subj.) faxis, faxit (Ind. or Subj.)‚ faximus (Subj.), faxitis (Iud. or
Subj.)‚ faxint (Subj.), Cf. 5 54.

Two views are held with regard to these forms :—— ’

(1) They may be syncopated forms for fecero, fecerim, etc.; cf.
Zumpt. ξ 161.

(2) They may be arehaic futures, formed exactly like the Greek by
adding -so to the verb-stem, e. g. fac—so =faxo as πραγ·σω--πράξω; the
tense in -sz'm being the Subjunctive; cf. Roby, ἐξ 291—3, Madv. ξ 115 f.

The philological uncertainty is not removed by the practical usage
