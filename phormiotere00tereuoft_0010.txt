(40-1), and so on. In this respect the text follows that of
Fleckeisen. ¹ ”

This Play, like its three predecessors in the same series,
has been carefully expurgated for use in Schools.

It is hoped that the stage directions, which have been
mainly suggested by practical experience at Westminster‚
may be of real service. As my opportunities of studying
this aspect of the Play were unique, Ι have endeavoured to
make this part of the edition as complete as possible.

Constant use has been made of the editions of Umpfen-
bach, Fleckeisen, Dziatzko, Wagner, Bond and Walpole‚--
the first two on textual questions only,—with less frequent
reference to those of Bentley, Zeune (containing the com-
mentaries of Donatus), Stallbaum‚ Parry, and Davies.

Ι have to thank my former fellow-worker‚ C. E. Freeman,
Esq., of Park House School‚ Southborough, to whose
accurate scholarship our editions of the Trz'nummus and
Andria owed so much, for his courteous permission to
make use of any matter which appeared in one of the
Plays above mentioned as our joint production. Ἰ must
also express my obligations to the Rev. R. F. Dale for his

kindness in reading through the notes and making some

valuable suggestions, Α S

P.S.—Reserences are made to Roby’s School Latin

Grammar as more likely to be generally accessible than his
larger work.
